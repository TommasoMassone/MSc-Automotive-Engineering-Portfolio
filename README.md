Collection of MSc Automotive Engineering projects (Politecnico di Torino). Focus on CFD, FEM Structural Analysis, and Vehicle Control Systems.

# Automotive Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio! This repository collects the key technical projects I developed during my MSc in Automotive Engineering at **Politecnico di Torino**.

Here you will find detailed reports and presentations covering three main areas of vehicle engineering: Aerodynamics, Structural Analysis, and Control Systems.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Aerodynamics & CFD Analysis
*Tools used: STAR-CCM+, CFD simulation*
* **Alfa Romeo Mito CFD Analysis:** A comprehensive study of the vehicle's aerodynamic performance, focusing on Drag (Cd) and Lift (Cl) coefficients.
* **Rim & Tyre Influence:** Investigation into how rotating wheels and tyre deformation affect the overall vehicle aerodynamics compared to stationary conditions.

### 2. Numerical Modelling & FEM
*Tools used: FEM solvers, Mesh optimization*
* **Structural Component Analysis:** Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis of critical components including:
    * **Engine Rod:** Stress distribution and mesh convergence studies.
    * **Vehicle Frame:** Torsional and bending stiffness evaluation.
    * **T-Joints & Cantilever Beams:** Analysis of welding spacing and structural integrity.

### 3. Vehicle Control & ADAS
*Tools used: MATLAB/Simulink*
* **ACC & LKA Design:** Development of **Adaptive Cruise Control** and **Lane Keeping Assist** systems.
* **Controller Comparison:** Performance analysis of PID vs. Stanley controllers in different driving scenarios to optimize safety and responsiveness.
