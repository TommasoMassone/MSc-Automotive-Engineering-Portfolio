# Automotive Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio! This repository collects the key technical projects I developed during my MSc in Automotive Engineering at **Politecnico di Torino**.

Here you will find detailed reports and presentations covering three main areas of vehicle engineering: Aerodynamics, Structural Analysis, and Control Systems.

## Repository Contents

### 1. HEV Energy Management Systems (EM4HEV)
*Tools used: MATLAB, Dynamic Programming, Quasi-static Modelling*
Development of control strategies for a Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) to minimize fuel consumption and battery aging.
* **Rule-Based Control:** Implementation of a deterministic strategy on a quasi-static HEV model tested on WLTP cycles.
* **ECMS (Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy):** Real-time optimization algorithm balancing fuel and electrical energy usage (tested on Artemis cycles).
* **Adaptive-ECMS (A-ECMS):** Advanced strategy with SOC feedback control to adapt the equivalence factor to real-world driving conditions (WLTP, Turin Test Cycle).
* **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Global optimization algorithm used to find the theoretical benchmark for fuel economy and battery lifetime extension.

### 2. Vehicle Control & ADAS
*Tools used: MATLAB/Simulink*
* **ACC & LKA Design:** Development of **Adaptive Cruise Control** and **Lane Keeping Assist** systems.
* **Controller Comparison:** Performance analysis of PID vs. Stanley controllers in different driving scenarios to optimize safety and responsiveness.

### 3. Aerodynamics & CFD Analysis
*Tools used: STAR-CCM+, CFD simulation*
* **Alfa Romeo Mito CFD Analysis:** A comprehensive study of the vehicle's aerodynamic performance, focusing on Drag (Cd) and Lift (Cl) coefficients.
* **Rim & Tyre Influence:** Investigation into how rotating wheels and tyre deformation affect the overall vehicle aerodynamics compared to stationary conditions.

### 4. Numerical Modelling & FEM
*Tools used: FEM solvers, Mesh optimization*
* **Structural Component Analysis:** Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis of critical components including:
    * **Engine Rod:** Stress distribution and mesh convergence studies.
    * **Vehicle Frame:** Torsional and bending stiffness evaluation.
    * **T-Joints & Cantilever Beams:** Analysis of welding spacing and structural integrity.
